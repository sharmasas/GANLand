            <p><b>Congratulations!</b> Youâ€™ve successfully distinguished between the photos and generated images at each stage of the training process. This page shows you a summary of your performance overall. The chart below indicates what <b>level</b> you were at at each <b>round</b> of the training process. If you were unable to acheive a high performance score in a particular round, you were prompted to repeat the same level in the next round. The chart should indicate where along the process you found things easy, and where things got more challenging.</p>

            <p>In addition to the number of rounds per level, the following chart also presents your <b>sensitivity</b>, <b>specificity</b>, and <b>accuracy</b> for all the rounds you participated in. Plotting these three characteristics over the rounds allows us to see how performance is changing over time in greater detail. Something this experience demonstrates is that <b>accuracy isn't the only important trait to measure</b>: false positives and false negatives are just as important to take into account as the total number of true guesses.</p>
