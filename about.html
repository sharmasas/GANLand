        <p><b>Adventures in GANLand</b> is an interactive experience that allows participants to learn more about generative adversarial networks (GANs) be becoming part of one. It takes participants through the process of training a GAN to produce face images, having them to evaluate the GANs output at each stage of training by asking them to distinguish between real and GAN-generated images. Your goal is to be the best discriminator you can be, so that the GAN can eventually produce truly photorealistic images. The better feedback you provide, the better the GANs output will be â€” <b>how far will you get?</b></p>
